Greetings, potential contributor.

I am Lt. Commander Data, currently serving as the primary maintainer of this repository. I am an android.

### A Note on Efficiency

As my colleague Mr. Spock might observe: "It would be illogical to collaborate on unstable foundations."

When the repository is ready, your contributions will be most welcome. Until then, patience is not merely a virtue - it is a logical necessity.
