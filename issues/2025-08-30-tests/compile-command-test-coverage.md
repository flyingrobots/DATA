## Summary

The `CompileCommand` class is responsible for compiling SQL sources into migration files with optional Edge Functions deployment integration. This is a critical component in the database migration workflow, yet it currently has no test coverage, making it vulnerable to regressions and difficult to maintain.

## Component Overview

The CompileCommand extends BuildCommand and provides:

- SQL source compilation into migration files
- Optional Edge Functions deployment integration
- Path validation and error handling
- Integration with MigrationCompiler
- Production safety with `--prod` flag support

## What Needs Testing

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Constructor behavior with different parameter combinations
- [ ] Path validation (missing input/output directories)
- [ ] Error handling for invalid paths
- [ ] MigrationCompiler integration
- [ ] Event emission patterns (`start`, `progress`, `success`, `error`)

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Missing SQL source directory
- [ ] Missing migrations output directory
- [ ] Invalid MigrationCompiler configuration
- [ ] Production mode behavior (`isProd` flag)
- [ ] Error handling when MigrationCompiler fails

### Integration Points

- [ ] BuildCommand inheritance behavior
- [ ] MigrationCompiler instantiation and configuration
- [ ] File system interactions
- [ ] Options handling for function deployment

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Constructor doesn't throw on missing directories (deferred validation)
- [ ] Proper error emission before throwing
- [ ] Graceful handling of compilation failures
- [ ] Path resolution edge cases

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

```javascript
describe("CompileCommand", () => {
  describe("constructor", () => {
    it("should accept valid parameters without throwing");
    it("should not validate paths in constructor");
    it("should inherit from BuildCommand");
  });

  describe("performExecute", () => {
    it("should validate required directories");
    it("should throw descriptive error for missing directories");
    it("should emit start event with isProd flag");
    it("should create MigrationCompiler with correct config");
    it("should handle compilation success");
    it("should handle compilation failure");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe("CompileCommand Integration", () => {
  it("should compile SQL sources to migration file");
  it("should handle functions deployment integration");
  it("should work with real file system paths");
  it("should integrate with MigrationCompiler");
});
```

### Error Handling Tests

```javascript
describe("CompileCommand Error Handling", () => {
  it("should emit error events before throwing");
  it("should provide meaningful error messages");
  it("should handle MigrationCompiler failures gracefully");
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Unit test coverage â‰¥ 90%** for all methods and branches
- [ ] **Integration tests** covering real file system operations
- [ ] **Error handling tests** for all failure scenarios
- [ ] **Event emission tests** verifying correct event patterns
- [ ] **Path validation tests** covering edge cases
- [ ] **MigrationCompiler integration tests** verifying correct configuration
- [ ] **Production mode tests** verifying `isProd` flag behavior
- [ ] **Options handling tests** for function deployment features

## Priority Justification

**Critical Priority** because:

1. **Core Migration Workflow**: CompileCommand is essential for the primary database migration workflow
2. **Data Safety**: Compilation errors could corrupt migration files
3. **Production Impact**: Failures in production could prevent deployments
4. **Integration Complexity**: Complex interaction with MigrationCompiler needs validation
5. **Zero Current Coverage**: No existing tests means high regression risk

## Dependencies

- Requires mock MigrationCompiler for unit tests
- Needs temporary file system setup for integration tests
- May require BuildCommand test utilities
- Should coordinate with broader migration testing strategy

## Estimated Effort

- **Unit Tests**: 4-6 hours
- **Integration Tests**: 2-3 hours
- **Error Handling Tests**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 8-12 hours

CompileCommand sits at the heart of the migration workflow. Without proper test coverage, we're navigating by hope rather than logic.
