## Summary

The migrate-generate command is responsible for creating new migration files from SQL changes. This is a foundational component of the database migration system, yet it currently has no test coverage, making it extremely vulnerable to regressions that could break the entire migration workflow.

## Component Overview

The migrate-generate command provides:

- Automatic migration file generation from SQL changes
- Timestamp-based migration naming
- Integration with existing migration tracking
- Validation of SQL syntax and structure
- Metadata generation for migration tracking

## What Needs Testing

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Migration file creation with proper timestamps
- [ ] SQL change detection and processing
- [ ] Migration naming conventions
- [ ] Metadata generation and validation
- [ ] Integration with migration directory structure

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Empty SQL changes (no-op migrations)
- [ ] Invalid SQL syntax handling
- [ ] Duplicate migration names
- [ ] Missing SQL source files
- [ ] Corrupted existing migrations
- [ ] Permission issues with migration directory

### Integration Points

- [ ] SQL source file parsing
- [ ] Migration metadata system integration
- [ ] File system operations
- [ ] Migration naming and sequencing
- [ ] Validation pipeline integration

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] SQL syntax errors
- [ ] File system permission errors
- [ ] Missing dependencies
- [ ] Invalid migration state
- [ ] Directory structure issues

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-generate", () => {
  describe("migration creation", () => {
    it("should generate migration with proper timestamp");
    it("should create valid migration file structure");
    it("should handle custom migration names");
    it("should validate SQL syntax before generation");
  });

  describe("metadata handling", () => {
    it("should generate correct migration metadata");
    it("should track migration dependencies");
    it("should validate metadata schema");
  });

  describe("error handling", () => {
    it("should reject invalid SQL syntax");
    it("should handle file system errors gracefully");
    it("should prevent duplicate migration names");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-generate Integration", () => {
  it("should generate migration from real SQL files");
  it("should integrate with existing migration sequence");
  it("should handle complex SQL operations");
  it("should maintain migration directory structure");
});
```

### Workflow Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-generate Workflow", () => {
  it("should support complete generate->test->promote workflow");
  it("should handle incremental migrations");
  it("should validate against existing schema");
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Unit test coverage â‰¥ 95%** for all functions and branches
- [ ] **Integration tests** with real SQL file processing
- [ ] **Error handling tests** for all failure scenarios
- [ ] **Metadata validation tests** ensuring proper tracking
- [ ] **File naming tests** verifying timestamp and naming conventions
- [ ] **SQL syntax validation tests** preventing invalid migrations
- [ ] **Directory structure tests** ensuring proper organization
- [ ] **Workflow integration tests** with other migration commands

## Priority Justification

**Critical Priority** because:

1. **Foundation of Migration System**: Migration generation is the starting point for all database changes
2. **Data Integrity Risk**: Broken migration generation can corrupt the entire migration chain
3. **Zero Fallback**: No alternative path if generation fails
4. **Cascade Failures**: Generation failures block all downstream migration operations
5. **Production Deployment**: Essential for production database updates

## Dependencies

- Requires SQL parsing utilities for testing
- Needs migration metadata test fixtures
- Should coordinate with migration testing infrastructure
- May need database schema fixtures for validation

## Estimated Effort

- **Unit Tests**: 6-8 hours
- **Integration Tests**: 4-5 hours
- **Workflow Tests**: 3-4 hours
- **Total**: 13-17 hours

Migration generation is where database evolution begins. Without rigorous testing, we risk logical inconsistencies that compound over time.
