## Summary

The migrate-promote command is responsible for deploying tested migrations to production environments. This is the most critical component in the migration pipeline as it directly affects production databases, yet it currently has no test coverage, creating unacceptable risk for production deployments.

## Component Overview

The migrate-promote command provides:

- Production migration deployment
- Pre-deployment validation and safety checks
- Transaction-wrapped deployment for rollback safety
- Production environment verification
- Double confirmation for destructive operations
- Integration with rollback mechanisms

## What Needs Testing

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Production environment detection and validation
- [ ] Migration state verification before promotion
- [ ] Transaction wrapping for safe deployment
- [ ] Confirmation dialog handling
- [ ] Rollback trigger preparation
- [ ] Success/failure reporting

### Safety Mechanisms

- [ ] `--prod` flag requirement enforcement
- [ ] Double confirmation for destructive operations
- [ ] Pre-deployment migration validation
- [ ] Database connection verification
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Backup verification before promotion

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Network failures during deployment
- [ ] Partial deployment recovery
- [ ] Invalid migration state
- [ ] Missing production credentials
- [ ] Database connection timeouts
- [ ] Concurrent deployment detection

### Integration Points

- [ ] Migration metadata system
- [ ] Database connection management
- [ ] Production environment configuration
- [ ] Rollback command integration
- [ ] Logging and monitoring systems

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Invalid production credentials
- [ ] Migration conflicts
- [ ] Transaction rollback scenarios
- [ ] Network interruption handling
- [ ] Permission denied errors

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-promote", () => {
  describe("safety checks", () => {
    it("should require --prod flag for production");
    it("should validate production environment");
    it("should verify migration readiness");
    it("should enforce double confirmation");
  });

  describe("deployment process", () => {
    it("should wrap deployment in transaction");
    it("should handle deployment success");
    it("should handle deployment failure");
    it("should prepare rollback triggers");
  });

  describe("error handling", () => {
    it("should handle connection failures gracefully");
    it("should rollback on deployment errors");
    it("should report failure details");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-promote Integration", () => {
  it("should promote migration to production database");
  it("should integrate with rollback mechanisms");
  it("should handle real database transactions");
  it("should work with production environment setup");
});
```

### Safety Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-promote Safety", () => {
  it("should prevent accidental production deployment");
  it("should validate all safety requirements");
  it("should handle network interruptions safely");
  it("should maintain data integrity during failures");
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Unit test coverage â‰¥ 98%** (higher due to production risk)
- [ ] **Integration tests** with real database transactions
- [ ] **Safety mechanism tests** covering all protection layers
- [ ] **Error recovery tests** for all failure scenarios
- [ ] **Production environment simulation tests**
- [ ] **Rollback integration tests** verifying failure recovery
- [ ] **Confirmation dialog tests** ensuring proper user interaction
- [ ] **Transaction isolation tests** preventing partial deployments

## Priority Justification

**Critical Priority** because:

1. **Production Database Risk**: Direct impact on production data and availability
2. **No Recovery Path**: Failed promotions can cause extended downtime
3. **Financial Impact**: Production failures have direct business cost
4. **Zero Current Testing**: No safety net for the riskiest operation
5. **Cascade Consequences**: Promotion failures affect entire application stack

## Dependencies

- Requires production database simulation capabilities
- Needs transaction testing infrastructure
- Should integrate with rollback command tests
- May require network failure simulation
- Needs production environment mocking

## Estimated Effort

- **Unit Tests**: 8-10 hours (extensive safety testing)
- **Integration Tests**: 6-8 hours (database transaction complexity)
- **Safety Tests**: 4-6 hours (failure scenario coverage)
- **Total**: 18-24 hours

## Special Considerations

- **Production Safety**: Tests must validate all safety mechanisms
- **Transaction Testing**: Complex database transaction scenarios
- **Environment Isolation**: Production credentials must be safely mocked
- **Failure Simulation**: Network and database failure scenarios
- **Rollback Integration**: Must coordinate with rollback command testing

The promote command carries the weight of production responsibility. Every line of code must be tested with the precision of a starship's warp core - failure is not an option.
