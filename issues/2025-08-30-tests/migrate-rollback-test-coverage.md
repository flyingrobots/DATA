## Summary

The migrate-rollback command is the emergency recovery mechanism for failed or problematic migrations. This is arguably the most critical component for production safety, yet it currently has no test coverage. A broken rollback system means no recovery path from migration failures, creating unacceptable production risk.

## Component Overview

The migrate-rollback command provides:

- Emergency recovery from failed migrations
- Safe reversal of database schema changes
- Production rollback with safety confirmations
- State consistency verification after rollback
- Integration with migration tracking system
- Cascade rollback for dependent migrations

## What Needs Testing

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Migration state analysis and rollback planning
- [ ] Safe schema reversal operations
- [ ] Migration dependency resolution
- [ ] State consistency verification
- [ ] Production safety confirmations
- [ ] Rollback success validation

### Safety Mechanisms

- [ ] `--prod` flag requirement for production
- [ ] Pre-rollback state validation
- [ ] Transaction wrapping for atomic rollback
- [ ] Dependency chain analysis
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- [ ] Post-rollback verification

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Irreversible migrations (data loss scenarios)
- [ ] Circular migration dependencies
- [ ] Partial rollback failures
- [ ] Missing rollback instructions
- [ ] Data preservation requirements
- [ ] Schema lock conflicts

### Integration Points

- [ ] Migration metadata system
- [ ] Database schema analysis
- [ ] Production environment handling
- [ ] Migration promote command coordination
- [ ] Backup system integration

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Database connection failures during rollback
- [ ] Transaction rollback of rollback operations
- [ ] Inconsistent migration state
- [ ] Missing migration files
- [ ] Permission denied errors
- [ ] Data integrity violations

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-rollback", () => {
  describe("rollback planning", () => {
    it("should analyze migration dependencies");
    it("should identify rollback sequence");
    it("should detect irreversible operations");
    it("should validate rollback safety");
  });

  describe("rollback execution", () => {
    it("should execute rollback in proper sequence");
    it("should wrap operations in transactions");
    it("should handle rollback success");
    it("should handle rollback failure");
  });

  describe("safety mechanisms", () => {
    it("should require production confirmation");
    it("should validate pre-rollback state");
    it("should verify post-rollback consistency");
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe("migrate-rollback Integration", () => {
  it("should rollback real migration changes");
  it("should handle complex schema reversals");
  it("should maintain data integrity during rollback");
  it("should coordinate with migration tracking");
});
```

### Emergency Scenarios

```javascript
describe("migrate-rollback Emergency Scenarios", () => {
  it("should handle catastrophic migration failures");
  it("should recover from partial promotion failures");
  it("should handle network interruptions during rollback");
  it("should maintain system stability during recovery");
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Unit test coverage â‰¥ 98%** (critical emergency system)
- [ ] **Integration tests** with real schema rollback operations
- [ ] **Emergency scenario tests** covering catastrophic failures
- [ ] **Safety mechanism tests** ensuring all protections work
- [ ] **Dependency resolution tests** for complex migration chains
- [ ] **Data integrity tests** verifying no data corruption
- [ ] **Production simulation tests** with real environment constraints
- [ ] **Transaction isolation tests** ensuring atomic operations

## Priority Justification

**Critical Priority** because:

1. **Emergency Recovery System**: Only path to recover from migration failures
2. **Production Safety Net**: Last line of defense against production disasters
3. **Data Integrity Guardian**: Prevents permanent data loss or corruption
4. **Zero Fallback**: No alternative if rollback fails
5. **Business Continuity**: Essential for maintaining service availability

## Dependencies

- Requires migration dependency analysis utilities
- Needs schema rollback simulation capabilities
- Should coordinate with promote command tests
- May require backup system integration
- Needs production environment mocking for safety

## Testing Challenges

### Complex State Management

- Multiple migration states to track and reverse
- Dependency chain resolution complexity
- State consistency across rollback operations

### Data Safety Requirements

- Ensuring no data loss during rollback
- Handling irreversible operations safely
- Maintaining referential integrity

### Emergency Response Testing

- Simulating catastrophic failure scenarios
- Testing under extreme time pressure
- Validating emergency procedures

## Estimated Effort

- **Unit Tests**: 10-12 hours (complex state management)
- **Integration Tests**: 8-10 hours (schema rollback complexity)
- **Emergency Scenario Tests**: 6-8 hours (failure simulation)
- **Total**: 24-30 hours

## Special Considerations

- **Emergency Response**: Must work under extreme pressure
- **Data Safety**: Zero tolerance for data loss
- **State Complexity**: Complex migration dependency chains
- **Production Risk**: Direct production database operations
- **Recovery Speed**: Must execute quickly in emergency situations

When all else fails, rollback is our final option. It must be tested with the precision of an emergency transporter operation - lives may depend on it working perfectly the first time.
