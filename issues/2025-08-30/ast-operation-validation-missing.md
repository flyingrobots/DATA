| **Brief Description** | Missing validation of operation structure before processing                    |
| **Impact**            | Malformed AST operations could cause silent failures in requirement generation |

## Summary

The TestRequirementAnalyzer processes complex AST operations without proper validation of the operation structure. This could lead to silent failures where test requirements are not generated for certain database changes, allowing untested changes to pass coverage checks.

## Details

### Root Cause

The analyzer assumes all operations are well-formed and have expected properties. There's no defensive programming against malformed or unexpected operation structures from the AST engine.

### Example

```javascript
// Current code assumes operation structure
determineTestRequirements(operation, context = {}) {
  const requirements = [];

  // No validation that operation.sql exists or is a string!
  const sql = operation.sql.toLowerCase();

  // No validation that operation.type exists
  const opType = operation.type;

  // Could throw or return empty requirements silently
}
```

## Proposed Solution

Add a validation method that checks operation structure before processing:

```javascript
validateOperation(operation) {
  if (!operation || typeof operation !== 'object') {
    throw new Error('Invalid operation: must be an object');
  }

  if (!operation.sql || typeof operation.sql !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Invalid operation: missing or invalid SQL');
  }

  if (!operation.type || typeof operation.type !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Invalid operation: missing or invalid type');
  }

  // Validate expected operation types
  const validTypes = ['SAFE', 'WARNING', 'DESTRUCTIVE'];
  if (!validTypes.includes(operation.type)) {
    this.emit('warning', {
      message: `Unknown operation type: ${operation.type}`,
      operation
    });
  }

  return true;
}

// Use in main method
determineTestRequirements(operation, context = {}) {
  this.validateOperation(operation);
  // ... rest of processing
}
```

### Known Unknowns

- What is the complete schema of an AST operation object?
- Are there optional properties that should be validated?
- How should we handle operations with unknown types?

### Unknown Unknowns

- Could the AST engine produce nested or recursive operations?
- Are there version differences in operation structure?
- How do operation structures differ between PostgreSQL versions?
