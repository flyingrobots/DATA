### Core Information

| Field                 | Why It Matters                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Severity Level**    | CRITICAL - Allows untested code to reach production                      |
| **Location**          | `src/lib/migration/MigrationOrchestrator.js` lines 161-168, 357-368      |
| **Category**          | Security/Bug                                                             |
| **Brief Description** | Coverage check exceptions allow deployment to continue in non-production |
| **Impact**            | Untested database changes could be deployed when coverage system fails   |

## Summary

The test coverage enforcement mechanism can be bypassed if `coverageOrchestrator.checkCoverage()` throws an exception. The catch block in the `checkTestCoverage` method allows deployment to continue in non-production environments even when coverage checking fails technically, undermining the entire purpose of the coverage enforcement system.

## Details

### Root Cause

The error handling logic in `checkTestCoverage` is too permissive. When a technical failure occurs (e.g., file system error, parsing error), the catch block returns a "passed" result with a bypass reason instead of blocking the deployment.

### Example

```javascript
// Current problematic code
} catch (error) {
  this.error('Test coverage check failed', error);

  if (this.isProd) {
    throw error;
  }

  // This allows deployment even on technical failure!
  this.warn('Continuing despite coverage check failure (non-production)');
  return { passed: true, bypassReason: 'Coverage check failed technically' };
}
```

## Proposed Solution

Strengthen the error handling to require explicit bypass even for technical failures:

```javascript
} catch (error) {
  this.error('Test coverage check failed', error);

  // Always block on technical failures in production
  if (this.isProd) {
    throw error;
  }

  // In non-production, require explicit bypass
  if (!this.coverageBypassReason) {
    throw new Error('Coverage check failed technically. Use --coverage-bypass-reason to continue.');
  }

  this.warn('Continuing despite coverage check failure (non-production with bypass)');
  return { passed: true, bypassReason: this.coverageBypassReason };
}
```

### Known Unknowns

- How many deployments might have already bypassed coverage due to this vulnerability?
- What types of technical failures are most common in the coverage system?
- Should we add telemetry to track when this bypass occurs?

### Unknown Unknowns

- Are there other code paths that could bypass coverage enforcement?
- How does this interact with the rollback mechanism?
- Could network failures during coverage checking trigger this bypass?
